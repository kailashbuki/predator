{"name":"Predator","body":"Predator\r\n========\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nPredator is a copy detection system. It is a fork of ROCOP-A plagiarism\r\ndetection system. Written in a completely modular architecture with state-of\r\n-art message passing technology, developers aim to provide a robust,\r\nindustry standard copy detection software with freely available source code.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPredator uses various Free and Open Source Softwares. Please make sure to go\r\nthrough REQUIRES file included in the distribution and install all the\r\nmentioned dependencies beforehand to run predator. Follow the steps below\r\nfor the complete setup:\r\n\r\n1. Execute the shell script install.sh;  \r\n    `./install.sh`\r\n\r\n2. You can access the rest of the features at `http://localhost` or http://ip_address\r\n    once you login using credentials given below:     \r\n        `username: admin`     \r\n        `password: admin`     \r\n    \r\nOperation & Administration\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nEach logged in user can set their own preferences for copy detection.\r\nConfigurable parameters are label and threshold.\r\n\r\nOnce the threshold is set, percentage match below the threshold value will\r\nbe rejected. You can also set labels with the color for the match percentage.\r\nAll the matching documents will be displayed with the label color and label\r\ntext lying in the match range.\r\n\r\nYou can upload the files in the repository by visiting the 'upload' link in\r\nthe main menu. You can select multiples files to upload. But the maximum\r\nfile upload limit size is 50MB at once for uploading & checking. For\r\nchecking the copy, please visit the 'check' link in main menu and upload\r\nyour file to check.  \r\n\r\n**In order to start all the predator services**     \r\n    `cd /opt/predator`         \r\n    `./bin/start_predator`     \r\n    \r\n**In order to stop all the predator services**    \r\n    `cd /opt/predator`       \r\n    `./bin/stop_predator`     \r\n        \r\n**In order to see all the service logs**           \r\n    `cd /opt/predator`        \r\n    `./bin/service_logs`          \r\n\r\nDemo\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nIt would have been even better if predator was hosted somewhere. But since i\r\ncannot afford to put this up, i have rather uploaded the screenshots here ...\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/kailashbuki/sets/72157629071025502/detail/\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n---------\r\n\r\nPlease see the LICENSE file included in the distribution.\r\n\r\nContacts\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Email the developer at kailash.buki@gmail.com for your feedbacks, suggestions. \r\n* Use the tracking system in our github repository at\r\nhttp://github.com/kailashbuki/predator/issues for any issues.\r\n    \r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPlease see the AUTHORS file included in the distribution.","tagline":"Copy Detection System","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
